[r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python) is governed by its current rules, [Reddit content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) as well as the [Python Community (PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf/) [Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/)

Please note that all interactions on [r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python) are [covered](https://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/2014-01-06/#management-of-the-psfs-web-properties)
by the [PSF Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/),

In general, this means that everyone is expected to be **open**, **considerate**, and
